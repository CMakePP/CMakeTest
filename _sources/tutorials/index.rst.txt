Tutorials
=========

The following is a list of tutorials meant to walk you through using CMakeTest
to unit test your CMake scripts. Each tutorial walks you, a few lines at a time,
through an actual unit test (each tutorials is actually autogenerated from the
unit tests in the ``tests/tutorials directory``). Generally speaking each
tutorial builds on the previous tutorial so they should be read in order.
