.. module:: exec_tests.cmake


.. function:: ct_exec_tests()

   Execute all declared tests in a file. This function will be ran after ``include()``ing the test file.
   This function will loop over all the CTExecutionUnit instances stored in the CMAKETEST_TEST_INSTANCES
   global, executing each one. All exceptions are tracked while the test is ran, including during
   subsection execution.
   
   Pass/fail output will be printed to the screen after each test or section has been executed, results are not aggregated at the end
   to prevent a faulty test from causing the interpeter to fail before results are printed.
   
   A test that is not expected to fail that raises an exception or a fatal error will result in it
   be marked as failing and no subsections will be executed. However, sibling tests will continue
   to be executed. All of the failures are aggregated and printed after all tests have executed.
   
   Normally, this would not be possible due to limitations in CMake. However, using the general
   exception handler, this function is re-executed whenever there is a failure, and it will
   then continue running tests that have not yet been ran.
