.. module:: exec_tests.cmake


.. function:: ct_exec_tests()
   
   Execute all declared tests in a file. This function will be ran after ``include()``ing the test file.
   This function will first write a file into the build directory containing a line calling the test function.
   This file will then be included, which causes said test function to be executed. All exceptions are tracked while the test is ran.
   Once the test has been executed, a flag will be set to execute the subsections, and the function executed once more.
   This will result in the subsections being executed, and their exceptions will also be tracked.
   Pass/fail output will be printed to the screen after each test or section has been executed, results are not aggregated at the end
   to prevent a faulty test from causing the interpeter to fail before results are printed.
   
   A test that is not expected to fail that raises an exception or a fatal error will result in the immediate termination of the interpreter
   due to unknown state and therefore leading to undefined behavior. To keep parity between different types of tests, EXPECTFAIL sections that do not raise
   exceptions will also halt all testing.
   
   .. seealso:: :func:`add_test.cmake.ct_add_test` for details on EXPECTFAIL.
   
   .. seealso:: :func:`add_section.cmake.ct_add_section` for details on section execution.
