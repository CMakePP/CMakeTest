.. function:: ct_expectfail_subprocess(_es_curr_section_instance)

   Constructs the files needed for a test to be executed in a subprocess and then executes the subprocess.
   
   This function will only be called for sections marked with EXPECTFAIL. Subprocesses are required because
   there is no way to handle exceptions correctly and not leave a test in an indeterminate state. A full
   interpreter shutdown is required to prevent code from proceeding from the exception point as if nothing
   had happened.
   
   This function first pulls data about the current execution unit and the current section from globals,
   then builds a tree describing the section's parents. This tree is then converted to a list of variable
   declarations and inserted into a template CMakeLists.txt. These declarations ensure only the section and
   its direct parents are executed to prevent a different section or test from running. Finally, the template
   is executed in a subprocess, resulting in the section and its parents being executed. The subprocess result
   code is stored, and if the code is reported as succeeding testing is halted since we expect it to fail.
   
   :param _es_curr_exec_unit: The current execution unit, used to pull information from the globals.
   :type _es_curr_exec_unit: string
   :param _es_curr_section: The current section, used to pull information from the globals and to calculate the parent tree.
   :type _es_curr_section: string
