.. module:: cmake_test/asserts/string


.. function:: ct_assert_string(var)

   Asserts that an identifier contains a string
   
   For our purposes a string is anything that is not a list (a list being a
   string that contains at least one unescaped semicolon). This function will
   raise an error if the provided identifier is not a string. Consequentially,
   this function is more-or-less equivalent to ct_assert_not_list.
   
   :param var: The identifier we want the stringy-ness of.
   :type var: Identifier
