.. module:: cmake_test/asserts/string


.. function:: ct_assert_string(var)

   Asserts that an identifier contains a string
   
   For our purposes a string is anything that is not a list (a list being a
   string that contains at least one unescaped semicolon). This function will
   raise an error if the provided identifier is not a string. Consequentially,
   this function is more-or-less equivalent to ct_assert_not_list.
   
   .. note::
      Be careful not to confuse this assertion with
      testing for the :code:`str` CMakePPLang type.
      This assertion only tests that the given variable
      is not a list.
   
   :param var: The identifier we want the stringy-ness of.
   :type var: desc*
