.. module:: cmake_test/asserts/prints


.. function:: ct_assert_prints(msg)

   Asserts that a specified message was printed.
   
   This function is used to assert that a string was printed immediately
   prior to this function call. This function only compares the expected
   message with whatever was printed last, it does not compare with
   any printed messages further back.
   
   If the previously printed message does not exactly match the expected message,
   this function will treat the expected message as a regex to check if it matches.
   
   :param msg: The message expected to have been printed, either exact match or regex.
   :type msg: desc
