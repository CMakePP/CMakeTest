.. module:: cmake_test/asserts/list


.. function:: ct_assert_list(var)

   Asserts that an identifier contains a list.
   
   For our purposes a list is defined as a string that contains one or more,
   unescaped semicolons. While a string with no semicolons is usable as if it is
   a single element list (or a zero element list if it is the empty string) this
   function will not consider such strings lists. If the identifier is not a list
   an error will be raised.
   
   :param var: The identifier we want to know the list-ness of.
   :type var: list*
