.. module:: cmake_test/asserts/asserts

   This module simply includes all of the various
   assert modules, so one only has to include
   this file to have access to all CMakeTest asserts.
   
   Most (but not all) assertions come in two flavors:
   an affirmative assert and a negative assert. For example:
   
   ```
   ct_assert_defined(AN_IDENTIFIER)       # Fails if AN_IDENTIFIER is not defined
   ct_assert_not_defined(AN_IDENTIFIER)   # Fails if AN_IDENTIFIER is defined
   ```
