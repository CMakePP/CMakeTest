.. module:: cmake_test/add_dir


.. function:: ct_add_dir(test_dir **kwargs)

   This function will find all :code:`*.cmake` files in the specified directory
   as well as recursively through all subdirectories. It will then configure the
   boilerplate template to include() each cmake file and register each
   configured boilerplate with CTest. The configured templates will be executed
   seperately via CTest during the Test phase, and each *.cmake file found in
   the specified directory is assumed to contain CMakeTest tests.
   
   :param test_dir: The directory to search for *.cmake files containing tests.
                    Subdirectories will be recursively searched.
   :type test_dir: path
   
   **Keyword Arguments**
   
   :keyword CT_DEBUG_MODE_ON: Enables debug mode when the tests are run.
   :type CT_DEBUG_MODE_ON: bool
   :keyword USE_REL_PATH_NAMES: Enables using shorter, relative paths for
                                test names, but increases the chance of name
                                collisions.
   :type USE_REL_PATH_NAMES: bool
   :keyword LABEL: Use relative directory name for CTest label for all the tests
                   in the directory.
                   Run a group of labeled tests with `ctest -L <label>`
   :type LABEL: bool
   :keyword LABEL_NAME: CTest label for all the tests in the directory.
                        Run a group of labeled tests with `ctest -L <label>`.
                        This argument has higher priority than LABEL
   :type LABEL_NAME: str
   :keyword CMAKE_OPTIONS: List of additional CMake options to be
                           passed to all test invocations. Options
                           should follow the syntax:
                           :code:`-D<variable_name>=<value>`
   :type CMAKE_OPTIONS: list
