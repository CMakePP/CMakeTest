.. module:: cmake_test/add_dir


.. function:: ct_add_dir(dir **kwargs)

   This function will find all :code:`*.cmake` files in the specified directory as well as recursively through all subdirectories.
   It will then configure the boilerplate template to include() each cmake file and register each configured boilerplate
   with CTest. The configured templates will be executed seperately via CTest during the Test phase, and each *.cmake
   file found in the specified directory is assumed to contain CMakeTest tests.
   
   :param dir: The directory to search for *.cmake files. Subdirectories will be recursively searched.
   :type dir: path
   
   **Keyword Arguments**
   
   :keyword CMAKE_OPTIONS: List of additional CMake options to be
                           passed to all test invocations. Options
                           should follow the syntax: :code:`-D<variable_name>=<value>`
   :type CMAKE_OPTIONS: list
