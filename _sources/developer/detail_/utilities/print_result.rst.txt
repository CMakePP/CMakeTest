.. function:: _ct_print_result(_pr_name _pr_result _pr_depth)

   Wraps the process of printing a test's result

   

    This function largely serves as code factorization for ``_ct_print_pass`` and

    ``_ct_print_fail``. This function will print an indent appropriate for the

    current nesting, and then enough dots to right align the result.

   

    :param _pr_name: The name of the test we are printing the result of.

    :type _pr_name: str

    :param _pr_result: What to print as the result (usually "PASSED" or "FAILED")

    :type _pr_result: str

    :param _pr_depth: How many sections is this test nested?

    :type _pr_depth: str

   


.. function:: _ct_print_fail(_pf_name _pf_depth)

   Wraps the process of printing that a test failed.

   

   This function is called after one or more asserts on a test have failed. When

   called this function will print to the standard output that the test failed.

   It will then print any additional content passed via `${ARGN}` assuming it is

   the reason why the test failed. Finally, this function will issue a fatal

   error stopping the test.

   

   :param _pf_name: The name of the test that just failed.

   :type _pf_name: str

   :param _pf_depth: How many sections is this test nested?

   :type _pf_depth: str
