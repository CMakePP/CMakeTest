.. module:: detail_/utilities/sanitize_name.cmake


.. function:: _ct_sanitize_name(_sn_new_name _sn_old_name)

   Makes the provided name more filesystem friendly

   

   CMakeTest will need to turn test names into file names in a few places. This

   requires the test name to be filesystem friendly. More specifically we:

   

   - Make the string lowercase

   - Replace spaces with underscores

   - Replace colons with hyphens

   

   :param _sn_new_name: An identifier to which the new name will be assigned

   :type _sn_new_name: Identifier

   :param _sn_old_name: The string that we are sanitizing.

   :type _sn_old_name: str

   :returns: A string containing the sanitized name. The result is accessible to

             the caller via ``_sn_new_name``.
