.. function:: ct_assert_string(_as_var)

   Asserts that an identifier contains a string

   

   For our purposes a string is anything that is not a list (a list being a

   string that contains at least one unescaped semicolon). This function will

   raise an error if the provided identifier is not a string. Consequentially,

   this function is more-or-less equivalent to ct_assert_not_list.

   

   :param _as_var: The identifier we want the stringy-ness of.

   :type _as_var: Identifier

   


.. function:: ct_assert_not_string(_ans_var)
