.. module:: asserts/list.cmake


.. function:: ct_assert_list(_al_var)

   Asserts that an identifier contains a list.

   

   For our purposes a list is defined as a string that contains one or more,

   unescaped semicolons. While a string with no semicolons is usable as if it is

   a single element list (or a zero element list if it is the empty string) this

   function will not consider such strings lists. If the identifier is not a list

   an error will be raised.

   

   :param _anl_var: The identifier we want to know the list-ness of.

   :type _anl_var: Identifier
