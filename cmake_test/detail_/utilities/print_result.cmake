#  @brief Wraps the process of printing a test's result
#
#  This function largely serves as code factorization for print_pass and
#  print_fail. This function will print an indent appropriate for the current
#  nesting, and then enough dots to right align the result.
#
#  @param[in] name The test we are printing the result of.
#  @param[in] result Whether the test passed or failed
#  @param[in] depth How many sections is this test nested?

## @fn _ct_print_pass(name, depth)
#  @brief Wraps the process of printing that a test passed.
#
#  This function is called after all asserts on a test have been run. When

#  successfully.

## @fn _ct_print_fail(name, depth)
#  @brief Wraps the process of printing that a test failed.
#
#  This function is called after one or more asserts on a test have failed. When
#  called this function will print to the standard output that the test failed.
#  It will then print any additional content passed via `${ARGN}` assuming it is
#  the reason why the test failed. Finally, this function will issue a fatal
#  error stopping the test.
#
#  @param[in] name The test that just failed.
#  @param[in] depth How many sections is this test nested?
