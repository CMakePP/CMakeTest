utilities
=========

This directory contains odds and ends that are used throughout the CMakeTest
module, but haven't been classified as belonging to other categories.

Below are quick descriptions of what all is in this directory:

- `input_check` : asserts for type-checking inputs to a function
- `lc_find` : searches a string for a substring in a type-insensitive manner
- `print_result` : wraps the boilerplate associated with printing pass/fail
- `repeat_string` : Creates a string of a specified length by repeating a string
- `return` : Syntactic sugar for adding a "return" statement to CMake
- `sanitize_name` : wraps the process of making a string filesystem-friendly
- `utilities` : convenience header for including all functions in this directory
