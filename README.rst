Unit tests are at the core of modern software development. As projects grow
in size and scope, so do their needs for extensive testing. The same can be
said for their build systems: as projects grow, their build processes become more
complex, and as such, those processes become more prone to bugs and failures.
Therefore, we believe that build system languages like CMake should have
a robust testing framework, just like most application programming
languages. CMakeTest is an implementation of such a framework
for the CMake build system language.

CMakeTest is modeled after the Catch2 testing framework for C++. CMakeTest is a
CMake module, written 100% in CMake. Tests are executed by the CTest_
infrastructure, minimizing friction for those already familiar with it.

Unit testing with CMakeTest relies on the
use of ``ct_add_test`` and ``ct_add_section`` special declarations, followed by
``function`` blocks. Within these blocks users write their unit tests in native
CMake; no need for ugly escapes or workarounds. The user then relies on
assertions provided by CMakeTest to ensure that the program has the expected
state. For example we can ensure that a CMake code sets a particular variable
using ``ct_assert_equal``. This looks like:

.. code-block:: .cmake

   include(cmake_test/cmake_test)
   ct_add_test(NAME "_first_test")
   function(${_first_test})
       set(hello_world "Hello World!!!")
       ct_assert_equal(hello_world "Hello World!!!")
   endfunction()

More examples and tutorials can be found in the documentation.

Installation
------------

CMakeTest can be installed via :code:`FetchContent` or by manually placing the
:code:`cmake_test` directory on your :code:`CMAKE_MODULES_PATH`.

The following CMake code allows one to install CMakeTest via FetchContent:

.. code-block:: cmake

   include_guard()

   #[[[
   # This function encapsulates the process of getting CMakeTest using CMake's
   # FetchContent module. We have encapsulated it in a function so we can set
   # the options for its configure step without affecting the options for the
   # parent project's configure step (namely we do not want to build CMakeTest's
   # unit tests).
   #]]
   macro(get_cmake_test)
       include(cmake_test/cmake_test OPTIONAL RESULT_VARIABLE cmake_test_found)
       if(NOT cmake_test_found)



           # Store whether we are building tests or not, then turn off the tests
           set(build_testing_old "${BUILD_TESTING}")
           set(BUILD_TESTING OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
           # Download CMakeTest and bring it into scope
           include(FetchContent)
           FetchContent_Declare(
                cmake_test
                GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/CMakePP/CMakeTest
          )
          FetchContent_MakeAvailable(cmake_test)

          # Restore the previous value
          set(BUILD_TESTING "${build_testing_old}" CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
       endif()
   endmacro()

   # Call the function we just wrote to get CMakeTest
   get_cmake_test()

   # Include CMakeTest
   include(cmake_test/cmake_test)
