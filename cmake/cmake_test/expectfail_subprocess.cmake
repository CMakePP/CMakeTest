# Constructs the files needed for a test to be executed in a subprocess and then executes the subprocess.
#
# This function will only be called for sections marked with EXPECTFAIL. Subprocesses are required because
# there is no way to handle exceptions correctly and not leave a test in an indeterminate state. A full
# interpreter shutdown is required to prevent code from proceeding from the exception point as if nothing
# had happened.
#
# This function first pulls all required information from the given CTExecutionUnit instance,
# most importantly the unit's parent tree. This tree is then converted to a list of variable
# declarations and inserted into a template CMakeLists.txt. These declarations ensure only the section and
# its direct parents are executed to prevent a different section or test from running. Finally, the template
# is executed in a subprocess, resulting in the section and its parents being executed. The subprocess result
# code is stored, and if the code is reported as succeeding testing is halted since we expect it to fail.
#
# :param curr_section_instance: The section execution unit object that will be executed as a subprocess.
# :type curr_section_instance: CTExecutionUnit
