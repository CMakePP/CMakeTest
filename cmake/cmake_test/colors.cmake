#[[[ @module
# This module provides an option called :code:`CMAKETEST_USE_COLORS`
# and a set of global variables to use to color terminal output.
# These global constants are just one-to-one constants of specific ANSI
# control codes. If :code:`CMAKETEST_USE_COLORS` is not set to true or
# if the OS is Windows (cmd doesn't support ANSI control codes),
# these constants will not be defined and should resolve to an empty string.
#
# Example:
#
# .. code:: cmake
#    set(example "${CT_Red}This will be red if the option is set${CT_ColorReset}")
