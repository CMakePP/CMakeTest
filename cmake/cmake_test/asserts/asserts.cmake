#[[[ @module
# This module simply includes all of the various
# assert modules, so one only has to include
# this file to have access to all CMakeTest asserts.
#
# Most (but not all) assertions come in two flavors:
# an affirmative assert and a negative assert. For example:
#
# ```
# ct_assert_defined(AN_IDENTIFIER)       # Fails if AN_IDENTIFIER is not defined
# ct_assert_not_defined(AN_IDENTIFIER)   # Fails if AN_IDENTIFIER is defined
# ```
